        <h3>a few things first:</h3>
        <h4>1. You must be 12 years or older to use Thisfits</h4>
        <h4>2. Play nice. Any content we deem harassing, impersonating or threatening other users will be removed without notice.</h4>
        <h4>3. Post appropriately. Thisfits-published channels are entirely public — you may not post nude, partially nude or sexually seductive photos.</h4>
        <h4>4. You must follow the laws in your jurisdiction (copyright, etc.)</h4>
        <h4>5. You are responsible for your own content: be your best you.</h4>

      <p>Thisfits is a niche social network that provides a platform for individuals to independently and collaboratively document their style.<br>
        The application is populated by channels that encourage users to post multiple times a day, without judgement or competition, and<br>
        communicate with other members within the same public or private channel. If we witness intimidating actions or content, we will terminate<br>
        the accounts of those involved.<br><br>
        Post away.
